# Creating an API with AWS: Lambda, DynamoDB and API Gateway

This folder contains [Pulumi](https://www.pulumi.com/) infrastructure as code that stands up the environment described in [Lambda, DynamoDB, and API Gateway for your Jamstack App](https://www.netlify.com/guides/creating-an-api-with-aws-lambda-dynamodb-and-api-gateway). The goal is to augment this excellent tutorial with some infrastructure automation.
